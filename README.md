# OmniVerseCLI ðŸ§©
The OmniVerseCLI repository is a command-line interface tool designed to enhance productivity and simplify interactions with the OmniVerse platform. Seamlessly integrated with the powerful features of OmniVerse, this CLI tool empowers users to streamline their workflow through efficient command execution.

## Building ðŸ”¨

OmniVerseCLI employs the Maven build system to efficiently compile, test, and package the project. By utilizing Maven, developers benefit from standardized project management, dependency resolution, and a straightforward build lifecycle. 

- You'll need Java 17 in order to build and run the package.

- You can build it just by running `./mvnw package` in the project root folder, the target file will be generated at `/target/` folder.

- You can always just use the most recent released version instead of building it. [Download it here](https://github.com/lucasapchagas/OmniverseCLI/releases/tag/release)
